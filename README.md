#The code is done in such a way that the costumer or the person booking ticket would be first asked which moive would they like to watch if that moive is not availiable then it says we dont have that film.
#If the person chooses the film from the list then next question would be his age which in the 0th index after the age verification person would be allowed to watch the film if the  tickets are available it says enjoy your film and if not it would say we are sold out.
#In the 1st index number of tickets is mentioned.
#In this python code i used strip(),title(),index,variables,if and else function,while true and dictionary
